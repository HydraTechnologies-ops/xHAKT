# xHAKT

xHAKT is a personal project developed to explore and demonstrate the benefits of blockchain technology in scientific research, specifically addressing the question: "_Do different types of phytoplankton have different abilities to absorb and sequester CO2?_"

# How xHAKT Contributes to Quantifying Carbon Sequestration of Phytoplankton

xHAKT enables researchers to easily document and source research data related to phytoplankton, ensuring that the data is accurate, complete, and consistent.

By using blockchain and decentralized storage solutions, we ensure that all data is secure and tamper-proof. The use of CO2.Storage further ensures that the system is environmentally sustainable and responsible.

# What are the Technical Components of xHAKT?

xHAKT uses the following components:

- Vite front end for user interaction
- Node.js server to process UI requests and surface messages to the user
- CO2.Storage validation service and the carbon-neutral CO2.Storage
- Bacalhau for data ingestion
- Hedera for final data storage
